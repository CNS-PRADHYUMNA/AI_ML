# Machine Learning Terms

## Classification
Classification is a supervised learning technique where the goal is to categorize input data into predefined classes or labels.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.
