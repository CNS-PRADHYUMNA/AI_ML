# Machine Learning Terms

## Classification
Classification is a supervised learning technique where the goal is to categorize input data into predefined classes or labels.

## Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality Reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.

## Regression
Regression is a supervised learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.
